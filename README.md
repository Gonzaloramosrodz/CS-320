Artifact: Contact Management Services and Summary Report
Reflection

To ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure, I apply rigorous testing practices, such as creating comprehensive unit tests, using exception handling, and validating all user inputs. In this project, I designed JUnit tests to verify that every method worked as intended and handled incorrect input properly. Testing helps prevent unexpected failures and reduces vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit.

When interpreting user needs, I focus on understanding the functional requirements and expected behaviors before writing any code. I translate these needs into detailed program specifications and test cases, ensuring that the final software meets user expectations. In this project, I made sure that actions like adding, updating, and deleting contacts aligned with the user's intended actions.

My approach to designing software involves breaking down the requirements into manageable components, designing modular and reusable classes, and using object-oriented principles like encapsulation. I prioritize readability, maintainability, and scalability to ensure that the software can evolve with future needs. Careful planning, thorough testing, and iterative improvement are the keys to delivering high-quality software solutions.
